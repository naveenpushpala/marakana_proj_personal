JDBC Pain Points/ORM Requirements

Code Maintenance/evolution issues
	- entity and sql can get out of sync as code evolves
		- objects must determine DB Schema:
	- one must know sql
		- should be able to just get objects from somewhere/persist objects
	*** no explicit relationship between entities(one-to-one???)
		- system must know relationships and constraints
Flexibility/reuse issues
	-code is tied to a specific SQL implementation (dialect)
General Ugliness/boilerplate:
	-very repetitive code, lots of try-finally
		-forget JDBC
	-checked SQLExceptions everywhere
		-forget JDBC
	-marshalling and unmarshalling is very clumsy

perfomance/correctness issues:
	-no joins
	-no transactions
	-no good way to create table if not exists


Servlet Pain points
	httpservlet API is restrictive
	it's hard to remember where different things were implemented, because they're all if-elses
